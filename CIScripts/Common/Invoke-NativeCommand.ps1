    # We encountered issues when trying to run non-powershell commands in a script, when it's
    # called from Jenkinsfile.
    # Everything that is printed to stderr in those external commands immediately causes an
    # exception to be thrown (as well as kills the command).
    # We don't want this, but we also want to know whether the command was successful or not.
    # This is what this wrapper aims to do.
    # 
    # This wrapper will throw only if the whole command failed. It will suppress any exceptions
    # when the command is running.
    #
    # Also, **every** execution of any native command should use this wrapper,
    # because Jenkins misinterprets $LastExitCode variable.
    #
    # Note: The command has to return 0 exitcode to be considered successful.

    # If an executable in $ScriptBlock wouldn't be found then while checking $LastExitCode
    # we would be checking the exit code of a previous command. To avoid this we clear $LastExitCode.
