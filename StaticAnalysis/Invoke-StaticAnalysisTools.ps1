    # Moreover, this warning cannot be surpressed in script analyzer settings. 
    # We still want to treat warnings as errors, so the only way is to filter out this warning
    # out of the analyzer output. Until issue [1] is resolved TypeNotFound cannot be
    # suppressed like all the other errors.
