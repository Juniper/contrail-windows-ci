This error is a symptom of incorrect removal of vEthernet (HNSTransparent)
network adapter. Correct behavior:
1. Ethernet1 has no IP address (it was "moved" to vEthernet)
2. After removing all container networks, vEthernet automatically disappears.
3. Ehternet1 gets its IP address back.
Behavior when this error occurs:
1. Ethernet1 has no IP address (it was "moved" to vEthernet)
2. After removing all container networks, vEthernet doesn't properly disappear.
3. Ethernet1 appears as "disconnected" and never gets its IP address back.
4. To fix the testbed to usable state, the reboot of the machine is needed.

Why we recheck it: The bug is not our fault, and the testbed is in unrecoverable
state, so we can't retry a test.
